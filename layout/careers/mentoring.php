							<p>Women in tech at all levels, from school age to executive leaders, need mentors to provide career guidance and overall support to lead them in different stages of their professional lives.</p>
							<blockquote>Women who had found mentors through formal programs had received more promotions by 2010 than women who had found mentors on their own (by a ratio of almost three to two).
								<cite>&mdash;Harvard Business Review</cite>

							<h2>Responsibilities</h2>
							Since the responsibilities of mentors and mentees vary based on the expectations and goals of the individuals, this is a basic list of activities broken down by role:

							<ul class="accordion noList">
								<li>
									<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="js-accordion-trigger accordion-title">Mentees</a>
									<ul class="js-accordion-content accordion-content">
										<li>You will set the tone of the mentorship relationship, providing your mentor with details about how you like to communicate, the frequency and your goals/outcomes for the relationship.</li>
										<li>Be flexible and realistic about expectations and timelines.</li>
										<li>Accept constructive feedback.</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="js-accordion-trigger accordion-title">Mentors</a>
									<ul class="js-accordion-content accordion-content">
										<li>Be an advisor to the mentee by answering day-to-day career questions like salary negotiations, how to deal with managers, goal setting, learning new skills, interviewing.</li>
										<li>Facilitate introductions to people and resources that will be beneficial to the mentee.</li>
										<li>Be clear about your availability to your mentee.</li>
										<li>Evaluate your mentee's progress.</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>

							<p>There are many common misconceptions about mentorship, some of which we tackle below:</p>

							<ul class="accordion noList">
								<li>
									<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="js-accordion-trigger accordion-title">Being in a mentorship relationship is time consuming</a>
									<span class="js-accordion-content accordion-content"><strong>False.</strong>The mentee and mentor can agree on the level of commitment and discuss time constraints. For some, a mentor relationship can be as easy as a few emails a month.</span>
								</li>
								<li>
									<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="js-accordion-trigger accordion-title">I'm not qualified to be a mentor</a>
									<span class="js-accordion-content accordion-content"><strong>False.</strong> There is no stage in your career, no title requirement, that makes you more qualified to be a mentor than another. A recent college grad navigating her first-time position is a great mentor for a young girl in high school needing advice for her next steps to undergraduate life.</span>
								</li>
								<li>
									<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="js-accordion-trigger accordion-title">I don't know enough to be a mentor</a>
									<span class="js-accordion-content accordion-content"><strong>False.</strong> Mentors don't need to have all the answers for their mentees.</span>
								</li>
								<li>
									<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="js-accordion-trigger accordion-title">Men don't make good mentors for female mentees</a>
									<span class="js-accordion-content accordion-content"><strong>False.</strong> There are many male advocates who are passionate about the growth and retention of women in this industry. They can provide another perspective. <a href="http://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Shining-a-light-on-the-male-mentors-of-IT" target="_blank">Learn more.</a></span>
