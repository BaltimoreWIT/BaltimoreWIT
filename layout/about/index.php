							<p>Baltimore Women in Technology is a platform for collaboration among women in digital careers and studies. We facilitate idea exchange, learning, mentoring and networking, and we advocate for diversity in our fields. Our community is comprised of a multitude of backgrounds, special interests and passions who band together to tackle the gender divide and create camaraderie.</p>
							<p>These special interests and passions have driven women technologists across Baltimore to create affinity groups and genuine grassroots movements throughout the region. Some these initiatives include educating and advocating for <a href="http://mdoutofschooltime.org/penn_station/folders/resources__links/baltimores_stem_landscape/STEM_Ecosystem__Digital_Version_.pdf">K-12 STEM programs for all</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DigitalHarbor/videos/922069061205818/">creating support systems for girls</a>, <a href="https://technical.ly/baltimore/2016/02/24/bmore-rails-workshop-women-important/">training women for advancement of skills</a> or <a href="http://jobs.aol.com/articles/2013/10/07/girldevelopit-success-stories/">career change into the digital world</a>.

Our common bond is clear though &mdash; our love for Baltimore and our desire to change the ratio. </p>
